\section{How To Go To Sinnoh}\label{sec:how-to-go-to-sinnoh}
Talk with Paul in Lilycove city to start the Sinnoh quest.
Check this guide here for a precise walkthrough:
https://pokemonrevolution.net/forum/topic/160991-how-to-get-to-sinnoh/

\section{Twinleaf Town}\label{sec:twinleaf-town}
Welcome to Sinnoh.
Go downstairs and talk with your grandma.

\section{Route 201}\label{sec:Route_201}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{walkthrough/Sinnoh/Route_201}

Now we can go and visit Barry in his home, go up and talk with him
and then we can meet him in Route 201.

Prof. Rowan is going to stop us from walking in the grass without pokemon
and be ready to choose your starter.

Now go to the right and go to Prof. Rowan lab.

\input{routes/Sinnoh/Route_201}

\begin{mdframed}[style=MyFrame,nobreak=true,frametitle={Pokemon Spotlight: Bidoof}]

The humble Bidoof may not seem like an opposing foe, but some of them are \emph{Moody}.
The Hidden Ability \emph{Moody} raises one of the stats of the Pok√©mon with this
Ability by two stages (at random), then decreases another stat by one stage (at random).
A Bidoof or Bibarel that stays in battle long enough can reach maxed out stats
and become an unstoppable threat.

\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{0.33\textwidth}
\includegraphics[width=0.33\textwidth]{walkthrough/Sinnoh/spotlight-bidoof}
\label{fig:spotlight-bidoof}
\end{wrapfigure}

The \emph{Moody} ability is perceived as so overpowered that Moody Bibarel has been
banned from most PvP formats.
Although \emph{Moody} will show up in only 5\% of Bidoofs, it may be worth the
grind in the early game to find one with this powerful ability, especially if
you do not pick Piplup as your starter.
The more common ability \emph{Simple} can also be utilized to double the effect of
\emph{Swords Dance} and make Bidoof/Bibarel a threatening foe.
Look for one with an Adamant nature and high IVs in Attack and Speed.
